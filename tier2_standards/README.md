# Overview of Tier 2 Software Standards

As part of the initiative to track and manage software for the JWST user community developed in the STScI Instruments (INS) Division, the Software Development Lead and Deputy have determined a set of standards that should be met by all projects that fall under this category. See the individual files on these standards for more information about their significance and how they can be added to a project.


The software standards identified to be met as part of the "second tier" are:

- [Software Must Have a Documented ``git`` Workflow](git_workflow.md)
- [Software Must Have a ``Code of Conduct`` File](code_of_conduct.md)
- [Software Must Utilize Code Review](code_review.md)
- [Software Must Enforce Coding Standards](coding_standards.md)
- [Software Must Have Backup Maintainers](backup_maintainers.md)
- [Software Must Have Documented Reasoning For Releases](documented_releases.md)
- [Software Must Have Some Test Coverage](test_coverage.md)
- [Software Must Use Continuous Deployment](continuous_deployment.md)
- [Software Must Use an Automated Dependency Controller](automated_dependency.md)
- [Software Must Have Documented Citation Information](citation_information.md)
