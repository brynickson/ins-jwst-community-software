# Overview of Tier 2 Software Standards

As part of the initiative to track and manage software for the JWST user community developed in the STScI Instruments (INS) Division, the Software Development Lead and Deputy have determined a set of standards that should be met by all projects that fall under this category. See the individual files on these standards for more information about their significance and how they can be added to a project.


The software standards identified to be met as part of the "second tier" are:

- [Software Must Have a ``Code of Conduct`` File](code_of_conduct.md)
- [Software Must Have Documented Citation Information](citation_information.md)
- [Software Must Enforce Language-specific Coding Standards (e.g. PEP8)](coding_standards.md)
- [Software Must Use Python>=3.6 Where Applicable](python_version.md)
- [Software Must Have a Documented ``git`` Workflow or Contributor's Guide](git_workflow.md)
- [Software Must Have API Documentation](api_documentation.md)
- [Software Must Have Some Unit and/or Regression Tests](test_coverage.md)
- [Software Must Define a Consistent Release Structure](release_structure.md)
- [Software Must Document Releases](documented_releases.md)
- [Software Must Have Backup Maintainers](backup_maintainers.md)
- [Software Must Utilize Code Review/Approval for New Changes](code_review.md)
- [Software Must Use Continuous Deployment](continuous_deployment.md)
- [Software Must Use an Automated Dependency Controller](automated_dependency.md)
