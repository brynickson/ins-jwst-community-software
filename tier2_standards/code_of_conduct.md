# Software Repository Must Have a ``Code of Conduct`` File

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description

A Code of Conduct is a document that defines the standards of the community and outlines how someone should behave when they engage with the community. It aims to create an inclusive environment for all involved.

Code of Conduct files in software repositories usually cover how to respectfully contribute to the software and how to address any problems that may arise.

## Importance of this standard

Code of Conduct files help to ensure ethical behavior within a software team and create an environment that is safe and respectful. It also serves as a document that can be referred to in case of incidents.

However, a Code of Conduct is only as good as its enforcement. As you are choosing one, make sure you understand its implications and think about how you will execute its terms  if it is violated.  

## Options for this standard

Software teams are welcome to duplicate an already existing Code of Conduct from another repository, add changes to an existing code, or make their own from scratch.

## How to apply this standard

Software teams should thoughtfully consider the contents they want to go in their Code of Conduct file. When they have decided, their final file should be named ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`` and should live in the top level of the repository.

Teams should continue to have their code of conduct in mind as they continue their work on the repository and be prepared to call out and/or report behavior that violates this code.
