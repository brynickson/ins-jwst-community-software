# Project Must Have Backup Maintainer

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description


## Importance of this standard

- Allows code to be designed, implemented, and reviewed by multiple people and different perspectives
- Double-checking changes before implemented in production branch
- Avoids single-point-of-failures
- Aids in knowledge transfer

## Options for this standard

- Ask Branch managers to identify someone in your group
- If resources do not exist, notify Matthew and Shannon who will then notify the JWST mission office


## How to apply this standard

- Notify Matthew and Shannon who will serve as backup maintainer(s)
- Ask Matthew and Shannon if backup maintainers don't exist

- What is the job of the backup maintainer?
    - Can currently be a developer
    - Can currently be someone who reviews code
    - But must be able to contribute to/change the code

- For new backup maintainers, we reccommend asking them to review any new changes
