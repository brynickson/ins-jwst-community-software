# Project Must Use an Automated Dependency Controller

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description

Automated dependency controllers are tools that automatically detect which of your third-party software dependencies are out of date, and automatically open a Pull Request with proposed changes.  These tools help prevent security volnerabilities and make developers aware of new updates to dependencies.

## Importance of this standard

- Ensure your software is up-to-date with latest dependency updates
- Ensure your software is not vulnorable to security issues from dependencies
- Ensure users that have up-to-date dependencies installed are able to use your software
- Helps to adhere to the software qualities perscribed by the mission office
