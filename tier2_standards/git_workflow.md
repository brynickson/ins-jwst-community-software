# Project Must Have or Reference a Documented ``git`` Workflow

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description

A ``git`` workflow is a documented set of commands that guide contributors through the various steps needed to open and merge a pull requst with proposed software changes, and for keeping personal forks and/or branches up-to-date with the main repository.  We ask that teams provide (or reference) the process that they use to make software changes to their repository.


## Importance of this standard

While ``git`` is an extremely powerful and important tool for tracking and providing changes to a software repository, it is also a rather large learning curve, and often times there are several ways to achieve the same end result.  A documented ``git`` workflow provides contributors of your repository a clear idea of how to propose and/or make software changes, particular to your project.


## Options for this standard

While we do not require teams to use any specific workflow, we highly reccommend using either the 'branching' workflow or the 'forking' workflow described in the STScI Style Guides.  These two workflows are clear standards amongst the software community and thus are well described in online documentation.  However, if teams require their own custom workflow, they may do so as long as it is fully documented somewhere within their repository (see next section).


## How to apply this standard

- Add something to project documentation (either referene existing workflow or describe project-specific workflow)
- https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/git-workflow.md (forking workflow)
