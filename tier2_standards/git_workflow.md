# Project Must Have or Reference a Documented ``git`` Workflow

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description

A ``git`` workflow is a documented set of commands that guide contributors through the various steps needed to open and merge a pull request with proposed software changes, and for keeping personal forks and/or branches up-to-date with the main repository.  We require that teams provide (or reference) the process that they use to make software changes to their repository.


## Importance of this standard

While ``git`` is an extremely powerful and important tool for tracking and contributing changes to a software repository, it is also a rather complex tool, and often times there are several ways to achieve the same end result.  A ``git`` workflow provides contributors of your repository a clear and consistent way to propose and/or make software changes.  Further, having this workflow encapsulated in a document allows contributors to refer back to the workflow at any time.


## Options for this standard

While we do not require teams to use any specific workflow, we highly recommend using either the 'branching' workflow or the 'forking' workflow described in the [STScI Style Guides](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/git-workflow.md).  These two workflows are clear standards amongst the software community, are widely used at STScI, and are well described in various online documentation.  However, team may opt to use a custom workflow for their project if it works well for them.


## How to apply this standard

We require that the chosen ``git`` workflow is fully documented somewhere within the purview of the repository.  If teams opt to use a workflow that is already documented elsewhere (e.g. the 'branching' or 'forking' workflow in STScI Style Guides), they may simply add a small statement somewhere within their project documentation (e.g. ``README``, a GitHub wiki page, etc.) that indicates which workflow is being used, with appropriate links to the existing documentation.  If teams opt to use a custom workflow, we require that the project documentation contain a full description of the workflow, with step-by-step instructions on how to apply it (similar to the Style Guides workflows).

- Add something to project documentation (either reference existing workflow or describe project-specific workflow)
