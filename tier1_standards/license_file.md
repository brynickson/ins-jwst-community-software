# Software Must Have a LICENSE File

This is one of the tier 1 software standards. See full list [here](tier1_standards_overview.md)

## Short description
A license file is a document attached to your software that defines how it may be used and distributed.

## Importance of standard
The license chosen for a software product defines how users and collaborators can work with your code, and it is what will truely define your product as "open source." Choosing the wrong license, or not choosing a license at all, may disrupt your users from sharing and editing your software.

## Options for this standard
The STScI style guide has made the recommendation of a BSD 3-Clause license with AURA set as the copyright holder. More information and an example of this type of  license file can be found [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/github-repositories.md#license)

However, to explore more about possible licenses you can look into GitHub's website [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) or see a full list of licenses in their [appendix](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/)

## How to apply this standard
- Create a blank LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md file in the top level of your repository
- Copy/paste the license you have chosen into this file
- Change the copyright year if appropriate
