# Overview of Tier 1 Software Standards

As part of the initiative to track and manage software for the JWST user community developed in the STScI Instruments (INS) Division, the Software Development Lead and Deputy have determined a set of standards that should be met by all projects that fall under this category. See the individual files on these standards for more information about their significance and how they can be added to a project.

- [Software Must Be Version Controlled in a Software Repository](version_controlled_in_repo.md)
- [Software Must Be Versioned](versioned_releases.md)
- [Software Must Use an Issue Tracking System](issue_tracking_system.md)
- [Software Must Be Installable with `python setup.py install`](package_structure.md)
- [Software Must Be Available with `conda` or `pip`](conda_or_pip.md)
- [Software Must Have a Recorded Environment](software_environment.md)
- [Software Must Use Continuous Integration](ci.md)
- [Software Must Meet Basic Standards for Protecting It's `master` Branch](protected_master_branch.md)
