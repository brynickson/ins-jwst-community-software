# Software Must Use Continuous Integration

This is one of the tier 1 software standards. See full list [here](tier1_standards_overview.md)

## Short description
Continuous integration (CI) is a practice where developers regularly integrate their code into the main repository and validate their changes by running automated builds and tests. This integration should happen often, up to multiple times per day, but the exact frequency will depend on the needs of the project. 

## Importance of standard
CI's automated building and testing allows developers to: 
- Reduce their manual testing effort
- Avoid long integration processes for large code changes
- Merge and test changes in small increments with no fear of breaking the code base
- Find bugs early
- Have code changes be more visible to other team members

## Options for this standard
A summary of the different CI options available at STScI, see the STScI Style Guide on CI [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/python-testing.md/#continuous-integration)
